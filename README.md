## Description
This is my portfolio. The user is first greeted with text that is being typed about me. They can then scroll down or click the welcome button to move to the navigation bar. From there, they can click on the About tab or Projects tab to move to either section. They can also open new tabs with my Github, Linkedin, Resume and Email. If the user scrolls down or clicks the "Check out my Work" button they will see my recent projects. If the user hovers their cursor over a project, the size of the box enlarges and the image is animated into a gif. Below my projects is an about me section with a picture and information about me.
